    <p>This was my first project, I was just getting used to Html. 
    This project was completely made of Html and no CSS or JavaScript 
    whatsover. It was about my YouTube channel AsapPlayzHD. I talked 
    about my creative yet unique personel. It's very interested you

    was pretty much my first time using HTML to build a website, I have
    had experience building websites before but not from scratch

  <div id="div1"> <h3>First Time Using CSS</h3><p>My second project was
  when I just learnt the basics of CSS. I added some style to the text 
  "ScriptEd" I changed the color and I changed the font. Little did I 
  know that I had the potential to do so much more with CSS.

  It was about one of my idols LeBron James. It talked about his 
  biography. I had many colors, different fonts, buttons and even
