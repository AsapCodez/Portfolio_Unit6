        <h1>About AsapCodez!</h1>
            <p>First of all I would like to say this page is about me! So I'd like to start by saying that I am 
            a very creative soul and I love things like cinematography and photography, as well as video editing
            I have a very big technological personel. I got into coding when I came to America, I also like things
            like acting. But anyway coding was introduced to me at around 2014. Before that in 2013 I just wanted to 
            do something in Technology. I tried things like being the camera man for my schools daily news program,
            etc. I found what I'm good at, at around mid 2014. Currently I am 13 years of age.</p>
        <h2>Why AsapCodez?</h2>
            <p>I chose the name AsapCodez because of my YouTube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaGz9c2WZIboXUm1VojDZxw">AsapPlayzHD</a>
            . I made this channel to show the world my skillset in Photography, Video Editing and other things
            I yearn to make people laugh as well as feel inspired. So as an act of Professionality I chose to make
            my name AsapCodez to match with AsapPlayz as well as my WattPad username AsapReadz and my long lost SnapChat
            account AsapChatz. Why look at my website? Look at my website because I have a lot of potential in the coding
            although it has been less than a year since I've been coding, coding is something I'm a fast learner from and coding
            to me is a lot of fun. I have fun making my websites. As well as I know what they people want, I have a pretty successful
            YouTube channel with 280 subscribers so I know that the people love me. Even more I am a kid so I know what 
            other kids want because of my preferences.</p>
